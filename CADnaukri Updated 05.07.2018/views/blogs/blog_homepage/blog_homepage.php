                      <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is always pronounced that “Scientists do big discoveries & Engineers smartly implement them into reality”; design engineering is one of the most innovative & lucrative careers for engineers where they can implement all their theoretical knowledge into reality. Engineering is a branch of study which is strongly based on solving of problems in its various spheres. Engineers take up the task after doing thorough background research before assuming charge for the same. It is in the DNA of every engineer; in-fact they collect all the requirements to solve a particular problem. They do some brainstorming, evaluate and choose a solution after all their requirements are met. </p>

                                One must possess strong concepts in engineering apart from having their own imagination, innovation & creativity to succeed as a design engineer. Every design engineer work tirelessly to design and shape their imagination into a prototype model which may be more complex than usual. The complexity ranges from a simple part to a large machine assembly or a complete equipment with several mechanical sub-assemblies in it. Design engineers with their expertise in CAD/CAM tools especially, the 3D modelling as well as real-time simulation for design analysis have greatly influenced the reverse-engineering of electronic devices, automotive components & industrial machinery. For example: automobile industry uses a lot of such softwares to develop CAD models from the older production drawings of components and often optimises them through re-engineering for better productivity.

                                <br><h6><ins>A must have quality in a design engineer!</ins></h6><br>

                                Strong engineering basics, sound knowledge in CAD-CAM software tools, detailed understanding of the product-prototype and of course a lot of patience to produce an error-free output. Every design does not require to be creative, but its surely an added advantage to their technical skills. An in-depth knowledge of the CAD, CAM, CAE software tools is a must to produce an output of reliable quality and cost effective when considered for commercial production. Aesthetics are an important aspect of designing of tangible products; we are often impressed with the fluidic curves of sports cars and bezel free touch-screen of smartphones but often the outcome does not meet our expectations as a design engineer. Designs are an outcome of practicalities and convergence of theory with our technical proficiency of software tools, but it is always not possible as engineering is based on calculations, ergonomics and not exactly done with assumptions & styling. Getting a degree in mechanical or automobile engineering opens a huge scope for career but, to succeed as a professional you must have skills to match the industry standard which is always in need of competitive performance from its employees and not the mediocre talent which is available in plenty with raw or almost no knowledge to understand the real industrial needs. Most students after completing their engineering must undergo intensive training in CNC operation, 3D modelling and rendering tools, 3D simulation of components designed in CAD using the CAE & CFD analysis packages. Once, such trainings are over they may opt for internship to gain the industry insights and work culture to hone their skills as professional.

                                <br><h6><ins>A well calculated life of design engineer</ins></h6><br>

                                Design engineers spend most of their time in understanding the real world designing to the living world where they could compare the similarities of a “Cheetah’s agility to run fast to a bike’s fast sprint or the flow of river to that of the fluidic curves to improve the aerodynamics for a superior chassis and engine”. A thorough R&D made on different products before rolling out the first proto-type model of any designed object. Most design engineers spend hours in their labs to do an-depth analysis of designs, modifications, etc. Most companies these days do outsource their “product-development” to those units, which are specialised for such tasks. Therefore, there is a regular interaction of design engineers with their peers to share and gain new methodologies to model any geometry; or to improve the hands-on skills for particular CAD software. Many use CATIA for car interior design and Creo for the engine development. Design engineers do a variety of tasks from preparing hand-sketched blueprints to detailed 2D in CAD platforms; 3D models with rendered views are often required for a very complex feature or part of an assembly design. Use of pencil, eraser and drafter has become obsolete with the use of computer software programmes that makes life so easy to handle such tough projects. The CAD software tools are often more futuristic and produces fine curves and bends in parts which are sometimes un-manufacturable. These are tough calls for a design engineer to balance their designs and utilise the most contemporary manufacturing process which is more convenient as well as cost-effective. On many occasions, designs which the client approves at the design centre comes back to us for either a small tweak or a complete make-over of the design due to its non-procedural designs that does not meet the manufacturing process of the facility. Even though such things happen almost in every case, a design engineer never quits his aspirations to produce the best again.

                        <h5>What does it take to shape brands that will rise?</h5>
                       Creative sparks , constant efforts, commercial skills as well as the man power to have same vision of company. With little in the way of a structured path into the industry, it is often by coincidence rather design engineers choose working for branding rather than skills related to design domains.
                           <h5>Brand and Design</h5>
                          If the branding and design go side to side in an area , you got to get on one . Remember the industry needs new candidates who are more than just creative to get their pace. The design field is always on the side of creative, the more you are the better you are. Understanding the business challenges and prospective , then addressing to it requires a certain sharp mindset , as well as an uniqueness to get through it.

                                Unlike IT industry , design industry tends to be smaller but specific to the works and their uniqueness. As such , it even plays an important role for the candidate looking to get into this design industry job because they will be getting roles according to their skills and they have stand on it. Despite of being specialist of the industry, it is the key for candidates to keep a broader perspective. Even if you believe you have identified the area of interest of you want to specialise with the side skill that value you more if you want to have a understanding of the wider industry.



                                The most essential stem for the growth in the design industry is simple- Be yourself . on a daily basis you will experience no. of different problems that will test your skills and capability . However regardless of the solution you come up with , the main aspects is how you handle your situation to get your work done.
